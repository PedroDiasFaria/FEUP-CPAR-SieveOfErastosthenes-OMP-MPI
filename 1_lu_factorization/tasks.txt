1.	LU	factorization
The LU factorization is a modified form of Gaussian elimination algorithm and is used to solve
systems of linear equation, of the form Ax=b.
1. Implement a sequential version.
2. Implement a block oriented sequential version.
3. Implement a shared memory version using OpenMP and OpenCL/CUDA (if available).
4. Performance analysis of the implementations.
The time complexity of the algorithm for a matrix of size (n,n) is Î˜(2/3n^3).
Data range to consider (n): from 1000 to 6000, with a step of 1000.
