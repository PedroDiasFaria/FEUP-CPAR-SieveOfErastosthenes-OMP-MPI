3.	Distributed	matrix	multiplication	algorithm	(SUMMA)
The Scalable Universal Matrix Multiplication Algorithm is a straightforward, highly efficient, scalable
implementation of common matrix multiplication operations. Implement SUMMA using MPI and
compare it to a shared memory algorithm (OpenMP, OpenCL or CUDA).
NOTE
Performance analysis consists in analyzing single processor performance and, speedup, efficiency
and scalability from 1 to P processors for the parallel versions. A discussion on the obtained results
is also expected.
